## About me:

I am a 28 years old male, have a specialist degree in electrical engeenering which I have earned in Belarusian National Tecnic University in 2015. After my graduation I have been working as Automation Engeener, in a nutshell my main duty is wriiting programs for programic logic controllers(PLC) and maintaining manufactoring facilities.\
Some time ago I took a dicision to become a Frontend developer, I have a wide list of reasons to do that, but the main is my interest to web development especially a user side part, because it also is my favorit part of my current job, I really like doing human machine interfaces(HMI), and as I suppose this experience could help me to become a great developer.
